Q.1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans. when you want to share your work with others, put it on a public repo for others to download and work. And when you want to access from mutliple machines.
Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: This is because I might not want to make public some of the local changes I am working on. Syncing automatically would lead to this problem.
